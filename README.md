This is my assignment for the Web-Development course 
The user can select how many ufo's can appear on the screen at once and the time they want to have.
The rules of the game and score calculation are displayed on a small pannel in the preferences page.
The ufo's keep respawning up to the number we have selected in order to make the game longer, more fun and arcady.
The records page displays the score and personal settings of all other users using the api provided in the task.
